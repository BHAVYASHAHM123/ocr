# OCR (Optical Character Recognization)

# Problem Statement:

Documents are an important aspect of many enterprises in a variety of sectors,
including law, finance, and technology. Automatic document understanding, such as
invoices, contracts, and resumes, is lucrative, offering up a slew of new business
opportunities.
Over the last four decades, there has been a lot of research into document image
processing and comprehension. Work in the field has been applied in a variety of
domains, including office automation, forensics, and digital libraries, and includes
preprocessing, physical and logical layout analysis, optical and intelligent character
recognition (OCR/ICR), graphics analysis, form processing, signature verification, and
writer identification. There are several decent document processing and analysis
options available;
The goal of document image analysis is to recognize text and graphics components in
images and extract the desired information in the same way as a human would.

# The main objective is-

1. Process the images of documents like certificates, ID (Driving license, AADHAR Card, PAN Card)
2. Extract data at the end and store in a certain format such as JSON, XML, and so on.
3. Following figure shows the basic diagram of how an information extraction system should work. Our goal is to extract the key information from the documents.
4. Create a web portal to submit the document and display the results on the screen.
5. Keep an edit option as well on the screen to avoid any mistake done by system.
6. Create an API as well.
